1. Study data for year 2017 of Massachusetts Public Schools Data, which is downloaded from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data?datasetId=2146. This dataset is from 
Massachusetts Department of Education (DOE) reports. The definitions about each column variable (field) could be checked in the following 
link: https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/help/data.aspx?section=assess.

2. Exploring our dataset and trying to become familiar with it with tools: pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

3. In the dataset, the assessment for 3rdGrade to 10thGrade is using  Massachusetts comprehensive assessment system (MCAS) tests results. 
For high school (from 9-12 grades), the assessments include %graduate, %attending college, AP tests and SAT tests. Therefore, 
I focused on high school to study our school districts because there are more outcome data helping explore the causal variables. 
We can focus on 394 public high schools in MA to do the next study.   

4. After studying all outcomes (they are highly correlated), ‘% 4-year college attending’ is chosen as my output data. 
With sklearn.feature_selection.SelectKBest, we can find the variable ‘% Economically Disadvantaged’ has the strongest regression relationship
with the output. Therefore, I started off with a simple linear regression using the variable ‘% Economically Disadvantaged’.

5. I could get that ‘% Economically Disadvantaged’ has an obvious linear regression with the output ‘% 4-year college attending’ for 
traditional public high schools. For school type: chart school, they perform better than traditional public high schools, especially 
in schools with a more economically disadvantaged students.

6. The next study is controlling for Economic disadvantage variable to explore the case that within the districts being with the similar 
economic resources which variables would cause different outcomes.
