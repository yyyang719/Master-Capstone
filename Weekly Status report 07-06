1. Finished studying Massachusetts Public Schools Data in year 2017 (1861 public shcools for k-12, and 302 fields), which is downloaded from 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ndalziel/massachusetts-public-schools-data?datasetId=2146. 

2. Gradually generated the motivations, the target audience, the input data, the expected deliverable output, and the main questions that 
I will try to answer in this project. This part is presented in ppt named 'master's_project_requirements', and uploaded in Cavas assignments 
number 2.
