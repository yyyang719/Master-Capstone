1. Study the Common Core of Data (CCD), which is a universe collection of public elementary and secondary education data and is administered 
by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Through CCD, I could get an overview of all the public school districts in USA and 
could also zoom in a specific school district to check its detail informations.

2. Take Melrose public school district as an example to study variables: median house price, median household income, Race/Ethnicity
distribution, parents education, Student Achievement, Per Pupil Expenditures, and so on.
